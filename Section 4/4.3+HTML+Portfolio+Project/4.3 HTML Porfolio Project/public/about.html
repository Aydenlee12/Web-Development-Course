<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Augsburg, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics.</p>

<p>My passion for coding and software design comes from my love of technology and learning.</p>

<p>Outside my school life and passion for coding, I love the outdoors and staying active. I enjoy fishing and hunting during the summer and hiking with my family and friends.  
I also love the game of soccer, which I have played for multiple teams, giving me the opportunity to travel all over the world.</p>
